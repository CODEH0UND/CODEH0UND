- 👋 Hi, I’m @CODEH0UND
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code like a pro both on the front-end and the back-end. I'm more fascinated with design and the front-end aspect of coding, and...
- 🌱 I’m in the process of learning all I need to know to become a front-end developer so that I can gain much needed valuable experience in the field, 
- apart from my self paced learning and personal projects that I will be undertaking.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate once I reach a level of proficiency that allows me to consistently create functional and well-designed projects that add value to the marketplace.
- 📫 I may be reached via email at vibzman01@gmail.com
